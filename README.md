The datasheet for the accelerometer along with detailed explanation of its configuration are attached. The code contains 2 ways of storing accelerometer value. It can be stored in a buffer or a dynamic variable based on the users interest. User can either use the buffer mode for DSP related applications (uncomment the required lines for this purpose) or use the normal default code.
